      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I am a passionate web developer based in Singapore. I enjoy building user-focused web apps with clean UI and efficient backend logic. What began as a simple curiosity — wondering how systems work and why certain tools behave the way they do — has grown into a deep-seated drive to build, improve, and innovate within the world of software development.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        My core tech stack includes <strong>TypeScript, React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS</strong>. 
        I'm also comfortable working with backend tools like Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        When I'm not coding, I enjoy gaming, watching shows like Eurovision, F1 and Kitchen Nightmares. 
        In the near future, I aim to pursue a degree in Computer Science, either locally or abroad. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn — I'm always open to new ideas, collaborations, and opportunities. I am also open to freelance projects, internships and full-time opportunities too!
